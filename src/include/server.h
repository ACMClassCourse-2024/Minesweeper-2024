 * be
 *     1??
 *     ???
 *     ???
 * If you call VisitBlock(0, 1) after that, the return value would be -1 (game ends and the players loses) , and the
 * game map would be
 *     1X?
 *     ???
 *     ???
 * If you call VisitBlock(0, 2), VisitBlock(2, 0), VisitBlock(1, 2) instead, the return value of the last operation
 * would be 1 (game ends and the player wins), and the game map would be
 *     1@1

 *     01@
 *
 * @param r The row coordinate (0-based) of the block to be visited.
 * @param c The column coordinate (0-based) of the block to be visited.

 * @note You should edit the value of game_state in this function. Precisely, edit it to
 *    0  if the game continues after visit that block, or that block has already been visited before.
 *    1  if the game ends and the player wins.
 *    -1 if the game ends and the player loses.

 * If the block being marked is a mine, show it as "@".
 * If the block being marked isn't a mine, END THE GAME immediately. (NOTE: This is not the same rule as the real
 * game) And you don't need to
 *
 * For example, if we use the same map as before, and the current state is:
 *     1?1
 *     ???
 *     ???
 * If you call MarkMine(0, 1), you marked the right mine. Then the resulting game map is:
 *     1@1
 *     ???
 *     ???
 * If you call MarkMine(1, 0), you marked the wrong mine(There's no mine in grid (1, 0)).
 * The game_state would be -1 and game ends immediately. The game map would be:
 *     1?1
 *     X??
 *     ???
 * This is different from the Minesweeper you've played. You should beware of that.
 *
 * @param r The row coordinate (0-based) of the block to be marked.
 * @param c The column coordinate (0-based) of the block to be marked.
